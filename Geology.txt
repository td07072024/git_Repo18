The Indian subcontinent lies atop the Indian tectonic plate, a minor plate within the Indo-Australian Plate.[33] Its defining geological processes commenced seventy-five million years ago, when, as a part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, it began a northeastwards drift—lasting fifty million years—across the then unformed Indian Ocean.[33] The subcontinent's subsequent collision with the Eurasian Plate and subduction under it, gave rise to the Himalayas, the planet's highest mountain ranges.[33] In the former seabed immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough, which, having gradually been filled with sediment borne by the Indus and its tributaries and the Ganges and its tributaries,[34] now forms the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[35]

The Indo-Gangetic Plain is geologically known as a foredeep or foreland basin.[36]
